I know you so well, so well
I mean, I can do anything that he can
I’ve been pretty—
I know you’re somewhere, somewhere
I’ve been trapped in my mind, girl, just holding on
I don’t wanna pretend we’re something, we’re nothing
I’ve been stuck thinking ’bout her, I can’t hold on (I’ll be feeling)
I’m in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
I’ve been trippin’ ’bout some things, can’t change
Suicidal, same time I’m tame 
Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer when nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin’ end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited ’bout the grave I’m diggin’
Havin’ conversations ’bout my haste decisions
Fuckin’ sickenin’; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
’Bout my uncle playin’ with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up
I’ll be feelin’ pain, I’ll be feelin’ pain just to hold on
And I don’t feel the same, I’m so numb
I’ll be feelin’ pain, I’ll be feelin’ pain just to hold on
And I don’t feel the same, I’m so numb
I know you so well (I know you, girl)
I mean, I can do better than he can
I’ve been pretty—
I know you so well

Oh, man, what a world, the things I hear
If I could act on my revenge, then, oh, would I?

Broken hearts, break bones, so break up fast
And I don’t wanna let it go, so in my grave I’ll rot

Nigga really wanna die in the night time
Only time I feel pain, when I’m feelin’ love
That’s why it’s tatted on my face that I’m damn numb
Only time I’m in my mind, when I’m all alone
That’s why I’m never really alone in the night time
Change hoes like clothes, I can’t get attached

It will all be over soon
And I’m always where the sun don’t shine
The tears don’t show, won’t hurt me now ’cause
Heart’s been broke, I hate myself, but
It won’t show, I constantly lose all
My remorse, and it’s ten for the wolf and
Three for the shepherd, and it’s one for the sheep who
Led by your leopard, often gave his perception as a
Handle of weapon, took a bite of your apple, give me
All you can offer, now I’m trapped in a changing maze
Setting my soul ablaze, couldn’t control the pace
Where is this going? Hey, heartless is recklessness, it’s
Word of a pacifist to war of a masochist, I’m
Off of the map,my Lord, I spoke to a Baphomet, he
Said he would save me if I gave him one thing he needed
"What is this thing?", I pleaded; boy, it’s the key to even, yeah
And as I spoke, my fangs were shown
Taken aback, he smiles and tells me
"What you crave will soon be yours
But what I crave is already mine"

Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?

What is money really worth if it ain’t love?

I heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
Heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
Heard shawty in love through the grapevine

Rest in peace to all the kids that lost their lives in the Parkland shooting, this song is dedicated to you
Okay, she keep cryin’, she keep cryin’ every single night
Day and night, on my mind, please don’t kill the vibe
All alone, swear to God, I be in my mind
Swear I wanna die, yeah, when you cross my—
Said I wouldn’t die, yuh, no, I’m not alright, yuh
I might start a riot, I’m so fuckin’ tired
So what’s up? What you say? Feelin’ good, I’m feelin’ great
Tired of the fuckin’ hate, stackin’ cheese all on my plate
So outside of my misery, I think I’ll find
A way of envisioning a better life
For the rest of us, the rest of us
There’s hope for the rest of us, the rest of us
Okay, she keep cryin’, she keep cryin’ every single night
Day and night, on my mind, please don’t kill the vibe
Oh no, I swear to God, I be in my mind
Swear I wanna die, yeah, when you cross my—
Said I wouldn’t die, yuh, no, I’m not alright, yuh
I might start a riot, I’m so fuckin’ tired
So what’s up? What you say? Feelin’ good, I’m feelin’ great
Tired of the fuckin’ hate, stackin’ cheese all on my plate
I should’ve let you know, that you’re my only one
I know you’re feeling numb, I’ll fuck you ’til you cum
Said, "I don’t understand, how you don’t got a man"
You want me in your bed, ’cause I’ve been in your head
You’ve been up all night, so you don’t wanna wait on me
I’m bouta’ catch my flight, so you don’t gotta wait on me
No more, you don’t wanna, you don’t wanna
You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna, you don’t wanna
You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna
I’ve been up a very long time, wonder why they hate on me
I don’t wanna love myself, I’m praying that they all love me
’Cause you don’t wanna, you don’t wanna
You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna, you don’t wanna
You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna
I should’ve let you know, that you’re my only one
I know you’re feeling numb, I’ll fuck you till you cum
Said, "I don’t understand, how you don’t got a man."
You want me in your bed, ’cause I’ve been in your head
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
How did you get here?
I’m drunk and confused
I tried to be patient with you, yeah
High up, you’re falling back down
Trapped in a concept, falsely accused
Was used and misled
Bitch, I’m hopin’ you fuckin’ rest in peace
Now the fact that I’m alone is fuckin’ comfortin’
And I can’t seem to shake this fuckin’ feeling in my…
Uh, cold shoulder, heartbroken, misspoken
I’m cut open, her fingers in all my stab wounds
And if she could she’d probably dance on my grave
Inside my head I see your face
I fuckin’ hate that I love you still, yeah
Carry on, like flights, I just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Carry on, like flights, I just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Carry on, like flights, I just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Yeah
How did you get here?
I’m drunk and confused
I tried to be patient with you, yeah
High up, you fucked up bad
I shot an angel with my father’s rifle
I should’ve set it free but I...
Our Father, hallowed be thy Name
I shot an angel with my father’s rifle
Thy Kingdom come
I should’ve set it free but I...
Hush little angel, don’t say a word
Bottle full of pills, passed out on the curb
Sun brings heat and it just won’t snow
Noose like a necklace on my neck, won’t go
I was too slow ’cause I won’t understand
Blade for your cries, count a penny for my sins
WiFi’s off and the lake don’t stream
Wrist down the river, not across, wanna bleed
Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don’t wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay
Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don’t wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay
Wake up to your face
I’m straight-forward, fuck a pace
What I want just so happened to be you
Couldn’t picture being a moment in your shoes
When I think back to the kidney failures
Broken promise, I failed
I won’t deny it, I held the ground you walk on
Heart stops, you walk away
You’re good today, you’re gone tomorrow
I carry my heart on my face, I’m so depressed
What good is sex?
I pray that you would love me less
And now it’s here, hand on my chest
Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don’t wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay
Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don’t wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay
Who do I have?
Help me in hell, my friend (my friend)
I won’t shed a tear
Let them see me in pain again
Hello, from the dark side in
Does anybody here wanna be my friend? (my friend)
Want it all to end
Tell me when the fuck is it all gon’ end?
Voices in my head
Telling me I’m gonna end up dead
So save me (save me), before I fall
So save me (save me), I don’t wanna go alone
So save me (save me), before I fall
So save me (save me), I don’t wanna go alone
Depression
And obsession don’t mix well
I’m poisoned
And my body don’t feel well
I hate her
Inside and out I feel my stomach turnin’
Make out hill
Where we met we let our lips do all the talkin’
And now
I’m hooked and…
Depression
And obsession don’t mix well (well!)
Hollywood motels
Hell, I think I’m just obsessed with you
Depression
And obsession don’t mix well (lalalalalala, lalalalala)
Hollywood motels
Hell, I think I’m just obsessed with you
And hell is just a government creation
And all the information they solicit isn’t nearly close to truth
It was clear since the alteration
Of the books our children study when they said Columbus discovered America, oh, the ultimatum
Of telling you the truth but oh well I’m already in hell
I’m tired of havin’ patience
So I’ma sell my soul and say some shit that fuckin’ bothers you
Jesus wasn’t white nor black, I can’t knock it
Was somewhat a Arab and one hell of a prophet
Don’t understand why J. Cole talkin’ ’bout false prophets
But didn’t mention higher-ups
Change your name to Amber Cole
These fucking entertainers is playing it by the rules
Sucking government dick for safety to stay cool
I’m absolutely disgusted by all of you motherfuckers
Tie your throat to a truck bed and pedal the metal quickly
The pain in my heart just won’t end
The words that I find just don’t seem to compare
Awaiting my death in the end
Alone, I must seek out the end to begin
So nobody wants death
’Cause nobody wants life to end
I’m the only one stressed
I’m the only one tired of having fake friends
Put the noose on my neck
And the hole in my back, again
I’ve been waiting on death with a smile on my face
This is the end
Waste of tears
Waste of years and months
Faced my fears
Loving her for once
Hurt me
Break my heart
Worthless
Can’t keep love at all
Turning, twist myself
Worthless
Can’t keep love at all, at all

Took a chance with you, it made me colder
Better on my own when it’s all over
So when I’m weak, who do I call?
My God, it hurts, I can’t be calm
What do I do? Where do I run?
I’m tired of hate, I’m tired of love
I dug my nails into my arms
She turned and laughed at all my scars
What is my worth?
What is my worth?
Gave my love a piece of me
She put my heart beneath her feet
She turned and left I question, "What’s my worth?"
Gave my love a piece of me
She put my heart beneath her feet
She turned and left I question, "What’s my worth?"
My worth, my worth
